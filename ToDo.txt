TO DO LIST FOR CARD GAME MOD
Section 1: Bugfixes and improvements
1. Standardize lerping impelementation, either by going back and adding timers to currently implemented steps, or by
adding int64 conversion to AI card movement DONE
2. Implement AI random card selection (Currently only selects the 2nd card)
3. Add timer to resolve phase in order to ensure that the cards that were pulled are actually visible for longer than 1 frame
before they start moving
4. Add a readMe text explaining the game and how its played
5. Convert the hand storage from hardcoded objects to list implementations for future convenience

Design Goal for Mod
Change the game from pure RPS to something with some form of thought involved.
Make it into a STS style card battler
One boss-esque enemy
Player has 5 different cards:
Block
Strike
Warcry (Buff)
Gouge (Debuff)
Flamestrike (Power Attack+DoT)

Boss Has a healthbar, loses health when attacked
Boss has 3 moves, will indicate what move they are doing between turns by changing sprite
Attack (Does Damage)
Block (Negates X Damage)
Buff (Increases attack and block value by 1)
