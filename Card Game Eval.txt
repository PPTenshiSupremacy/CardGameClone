I found this project to be pretty fun. organizing the code into a proper state machine was a fun xercise, and forced me 
to think a lot more in advance about how I wanted to do the project and how it should be structured.
I've included the text of my pre-planning document into here, just to show my work.
I think that the hardest part of this was juggling the sheer amount of states I had to work with, mainly because of the way I chose
to code it, which is handling hands and stuff w/out using arrays.
